hi, my name's Jes.

back in the day, I helped build patreon itself. and I said "hey, I'm an artist, I make pretty algorithms". But then I made like one piece that whole year. and then I moved back to Oregon, and life kept happening, and I didn't make much art.

But now: I have a house in the woods. I job that leaves me with some space brain cycles. I have better antidepressants.

And suddenly, I'm making things again.

Here are some of them. Maybe you will like them.
